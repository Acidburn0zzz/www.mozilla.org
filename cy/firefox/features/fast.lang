;Firefox is now faster and leaner
Mae Firefox yn gynt ac yn fwy heini


# Working out means exercising to get lighter and more proficent.  Here it means Firefox is lighter thus the speed faster.
;We’ve been working out, so you can get more done.
Rydym wedi bod yn ymarfer, fel bod modd i chi gyflawni mwy.


;Use less memory
Defnyddio llai o gof


# A hog is something that claims or takes all of everything. Here it references to a program that takes up all the resources and slow down the computer.
# Lean and mean here means having no excess of what's needed and is single focused. Mean also is defined as nasty, thus the reference of "we're pretty nice". Be transcreative if needed.
;No one likes a computer hog! Firefox is a lean, mean (actually we’re pretty nice) browsing machine. Since we use less RAM than Chrome, your other programs can keep running at top speed.
Does neb yn hoffi rhaglen sy'n cymryd yr adnoddau i gyd! Mae Firefox yn beiriant pori cynnil iawn. Gan ein bod yn defnyddio llai o RAM na Chrome, mae eich rhaglenni eraill yn gallu parhau i weithio.
