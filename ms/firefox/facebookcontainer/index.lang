;Facebook can track almost all your web activity and tie it to your Facebook identity. If that’s too much for you, the <a href="%(fbcontainer)s">Facebook Container extension</a> isolates your identity into a separate container tab, making it harder for Facebook to track you on the web outside of Facebook.

;Installing the <a href="%(fbcontainer)s">extension</a> is easy and, once activated, will open Facebook in a blue tab each time you use it. Use and enjoy Facebook normally. Facebook will still be able to send you advertising and recommendations on their site, but it will be much harder for Facebook to use your activity collected <strong>off Facebook</strong> to send you ads and other targeted messages.
