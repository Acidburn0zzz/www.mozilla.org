;Mozilla’s Key Internet Issues
Mozilla의 주요 인터넷 문제


;Shaping the Agenda
아젠다 설정


;Mozilla has identified five issues that we believe must be tackled in the current era, to build the open internet we want:
Mozilla는 우리가 원하는 개방된 인터넷을 만들기 위해 다뤄져야만 하는 현재 시대의 5가지 이슈를 설정하였습니다:


;Online Privacy & Security
온라인 개인 정보 보호 및 보안


;People understand and can meaningfully control how their data is collected and used online, and trust that it’s safe. In parallel, companies and governments work to protect our data and enhance our ownership over our digital identities.
사람들은 그들의 데이타가 온라인에서 수집되고 사용되는데에 대한 의미있는 제어를 할 수 있어야 하고 그 데이타가 안전하다고 믿을 수 있어야 합니다. 동시에 기업과 정부는 데이터를 보호하도록 노력해야 하고 디지털환경에서의 개인에 대한 데이타 소유권을 강화해야 합니다.


;Open Innovation
공개 혁신


;Open is the default: open source and open standards continue to be at the heart of the Internet, and influence organizations and industries products, policies and practices. As a result, entrepreneurs and everyday Internet users can create, innovate and compete online without asking permission.
공개는 기본입니다: 오픈 소스와 공개 표준은 계속해서 인터넷의 핵심이 되고 조직과 산업제품, 정책, 실행에 영향을 미칩니다. 결과적으로 기업인과 인터넷을 사용하는 모든 사람은 권한에 대한 요청없이 온라인을 만들고 혁신하고 경쟁합니다.


;Decentralization
탈중앙화


;The technologies and platforms people use every day are interoperable and based on open standards. People expect and demand systems that allow seamless flow and transfer of information and content.

;Web Literacy
Web Literacy


;People have the skills to read, write and participate in the digital world. Together, these informed digital citizens move beyond just consuming content, to creating, shaping and defending the web.

;Digital Inclusion
디지털 통합


;People everywhere can access and have the opportunity to participate in building the entire Internet. Subsequently, everyone on the Internet has the opportunity to access and shape our digital world. The Internet reflects the diversity of the people who use it.

;Mozilla and our allies will bring these issues front-and-center by being an increasingly visible public voice, weaving these issues throughout our leadership and advocacy work, and building technologies that take a stance.
