;Lightbeam for Firefox
Firefox용 Lightbeam


;Lightbeam is a Firefox add-on that uses interactive visualizations to show you the first and third party sites you interact with on the Web.
Lightbeam은 Firefox용 부가 기능에서 사용자가 직접 상호 작용하는 웹 사이트 및 다른 사이트와의 연결을 대화식으로 시각화하는 도구입니다.

;Shine a Light on Who’s Watching You
온라인 추적 사이트에 대한 시각적 분석


;See who’s tracking you online

;As you browse, Lightbeam reveals the full depth of the Web today, including parts that are not transparent to the average user.
Lightbeam에 의해 웹 브라우징 도중 일반 사용자에게 보이지 않는 부분을 포함하여 웹의 현재 모습을 깊이있고 분명하게 알 수 있습니다.

;How Lightbeam Works
Lightbeam 동작 방식


;Download and run the Lightbeam add-on in your Firefox browser.
Firefox 브라우저에 Lightbeam 부가 기능을 다운로드 및 설치합니다.


;Lightbeam will create a record of events for every site you visit and every third party site that is stored locally on your browser.
사용자가 방문하는 모든 사이트와 브라우저에서 로컬에 저장되는 다른 사이트에 대한 이벤트 기록이 Lightbeam에 의해 만들어집니다.


;Lightbeam visually graphs these events to highlight the interactions between sites you intentionally visit and the third parties.
Lightbeam에 의해 이러한 이벤트를 그래프로 시각화하여 사용자가 의도적으로 접근 한 사이트 및 다른 사이트와의 상호 작용이 밝혀집니다.


;Lightbeam will continue to add to your graph as you browse the Web. You can stop Lightbeam at any time by disabling it or uninstalling the add-on. Your Lightbeam data can be easily saved or deleted.
사용자가 웹 브라우징을 시작하면 그 사이트의 정보를 Lightbeam에 의해 사용자의 그래프에 지속적으로 추가됩니다. Lightbeam은 비활성화 및 제거함으로써 언제든지 중지 할 수 있습니다. Lightbeam의 데이터 저장과 삭제도 쉽게 할 수 있습니다.


;Tracking & privacy
추적과 개인 정보 보호


;Not all tracking is bad. Many services rely on user data to provide relevant content and enhance your online experience.
사용자 추적이 항상 나쁜 것은 아닙니다. 많은 서비스는 사용자 데이터를 기반으로 사용자와 관련된 콘텐츠를 제공하고 사용자의 온라인 경험을 향상시킵니다.


;But tracking can happen without the user’s knowledge.
그러나 사용자가 모르는 사이에 추적 할 수 있습니다.


;That’s not okay for some.
그것은 바람직하지 않은 경우가 있습니다.


;It should be you who decides when, how and if you want your browsing data to be shared. We recognize the importance of transparency and our mission is all about empowering users — both with tools and information.
사용자의 인터넷 사용 기록을 공유하는 타이밍 방법 공유 여부를 결정하는 것은 사용자가 직접해야합니다. Mozilla는 투명성이 중요하다는 것을 인식하고 도구 및 정보를 제공함으로써 사용자에게 힘을주는 것을 사명으로 생각하고 있습니다.


;Explore the database
데이터베이스 조사


;In the Lightbeam database, you will be able to browse first and third-party connection data uploaded by donors who use the Lightbeam add-on.
Lightbeam 데이터베이스에서는 Lightbeam 부가 기능 사용자가 제공 및 업로드한 자신의 사이트와 다른 사이트의 관계를 나타내는 데이터를 볼 수 있습니다.


;We’re building this crowd-sourced directory to encourage users to visualize the state of tracking as an aggregate and to examine relationships that exist on the Web.
Mozilla는 클라우드 소스 디렉토리를 구축함으로써 추적에 대한 전체를 시각화하고, 웹 상에 존재하는 관계를 검증하는 활동을 추진하고 있습니다.


;Visualize your data
사용자 데이터 시각화


;After you download and install the Lightbeam add-on to Firefox, it will begin to create a real time visualization of the websites you visit and all the third parties that are also active on those pages.
Lightbeam 부가 기능을 다운로드하여 Firefox에 설치하면, 사용자가 접근하는 웹 사이트와 페이지에 당시에 활성화된 모든 웹 사이트 시각화가 시작됩니다.


;Analyze your connections
사용자 연결 현황 분석


;As your visualizations grow, you can take a closer look into the relationships between the various first and third party sites that are stored in your data. You can also reset or save your data at any time.
사용자별 시각화가 계속 축적되면, 사용자의 데이터에 저장되어있는 다양한 웹 사이트와 다른 사이트와의 관계를 더 자세히 알게됩니다. 데이터의 초기화 및 저장도 가능합니다.


;Contribute your data
사용자 데이터 제공


;As a part of Lightbeam, we are creating a big-picture view of Internet tracking and of how first and third party sites are connected.
Lightbeam 기능의 일환으로 Mozilla는 인터넷상에서 추적 상황이나 웹 사이트와 다른 사이트가 어떻게 연결되어 있는지를 나타내는 큰 그림을 만들고 있습니다.


;To help us, you can contribute your data to our Lightbeam database.
