;The heart of Mozilla is people. We put people first and do our best to recognize, appreciate and respect the diversity of our global contributors. The Mozilla Project welcomes contributions from everyone who shares our goals and wants to contribute in a healthy and constructive manner within our community. As such, we have adopted this code of conduct and require all those who participate to agree and adhere to these Community Participation Guidelines in order to help us create a safe and positive community experience for all.
Mozilla 坚持以人为本。我们将众人放在第一位，尽最大努力来认识、欣赏并尊重全球贡献者的多样性。Mozilla 项目欢迎任何志同道合的人，在社区中以健康和建设性的方式作出贡献。因此，我们特别编写这份行为准则，并要求所有参与者同意并遵循此准则，一同营造出安全且积极的社区体验。


;These guidelines aim to support a community where all people should feel safe to participate, introduce new ideas and inspire others, regardless of:
这份准则旨在无论参与者有下列任何不同，都能提供一个让任何人都能安心参与、引入新思想，并且鼓励他人的社区：

;Openness, collaboration and participation are core aspects of our work — from development on Firefox to collaboratively designing curriculum. We gain strength from diversity and actively seek participation from those who enhance it. These guidelines exist to enable diverse individuals and groups to interact and collaborate to mutual advantage. This document outlines both expected and prohibited behavior.
开放性、协作性和参与性是我们工作的核心层面 — 从 Firefox 开发到协作设计课程。我们从多样性中获得力量，并积极寻求深谙多样性原则的人士参与。这些准则的存在是为了使不同的个人和群体能够进行互动和协作以实现互惠互利。本文档概述了鼓励和不鼓励的行为。


;When and How to Use These Guidelines
何时以及如何使用这些准则


;These guidelines outline our behavior expectations as members of the Mozilla community in all Mozilla activities, both offline and online. Your participation is contingent upon following these guidelines in all Mozilla activities, including but not limited to:
这些准则概述我们鼓励 Mozilla 社区的成员在线下与线上的所有 Mozilla 活动中表现的行为。您须在参与所有的 Mozilla 活动时，遵循这些准则，包括但不限于：


;Working in Mozilla spaces.
在 Mozilla Space 工作或参与活动。


;Working with other Mozillians and other Mozilla community participants virtually or co-located.
与谋智人和其他 Mozilla 社区参与者通过虚拟方式或共处一地开展活动。


;Representing Mozilla at public events.
代表 Mozilla 出席公共活动。


;Representing Mozilla in social media (official accounts, staff accounts, personal accounts, Facebook pages).
代表 Mozilla 运营社交媒体（官方账户、员工账户、个人账户、Facebook 页面）。


;Participating in Mozilla offsites and trainings.
参与 Mozilla 场外活动和培训。


;Participating in Mozilla-related forums, mailing lists, wikis, websites, chat channels, bugs, group or person-to-person meetings, and Mozilla-related correspondence.
参加与 Mozilla 相关的论坛、邮件列表、Wiki、网站、聊天频道、报告缺陷（Bug）、群组或面对面会议以及与 Mozilla 有关的通信。


;These guidelines work in conjunction with our Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policies<a href="%(note1)s">[1]</a>, which sets out protections for, and obligations of, Mozilla employees. The Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policy is crafted with specific legal definitions and requirements in mind.
这些准则与我们的反骚扰/歧视政策 <a href="%(note1)s">[1]</a> 一并使用，规定了Mozilla 员工所享有的保护和义务。反骚扰/歧视政策的制定已考虑到明确的法律定义和要求。


;While these guidelines / code of conduct are specifically aimed at Mozilla’s work and community, we recognize that it is possible for actions taken outside of Mozilla’s online or inperson spaces to have a deep impact on community health. (For example, in the past, we publicly identified an anonymous posting aimed at a Mozilla employee in a non-Mozilla forum as clear grounds for removal from the Mozilla community.) This is an active topic in the diversity and inclusion realm. We anticipate wide-ranging discussions among our communities about appropriate boundaries.
虽然这些准则/行为守则是只面向 Mozilla 的工作和社区，不过我们也承认在 Mozilla 的网络或个人空间以外所采取的行动，也可能会对社区的健康产生深远影响。（例如：我们曾将某个非 Mozilla 论坛中针对 Mozilla 员工的公开匿名帖子，作为要求其退出 Mozilla 社区的明确理由。）这是多样性和包容性领域的重要课题。我们期望社区可以就适当的界限进行广泛的讨论。

;Expected Behavior
鼓励的行为


;The following behaviors are expected of all Mozillians:
期许所有谋智人的行为举止如下：


;Be Respectful
相互尊重


;Value each other’s ideas, styles and viewpoints. We may not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for poor manners. Be open to different possibilities and to being wrong. Be respectful in all interactions and communications, especially when debating the merits of different options. Be aware of your impact and how intense interactions may be affecting people. Be direct, constructive and positive. Take responsibility for your impact and your mistakes – if someone says they have been harmed through your words or actions, listen carefully, apologize sincerely, and correct the behavior going forward.
重视彼此的想法、风格和观点。我们也许并不总是能够达成共识，但意见分歧绝非无礼的借口。请对不同的可能性和错误持开放态度。尤其是在讨论不同选择的优劣时，应在所有的交流和沟通中保持尊重。要意识到您的影响以及强烈的互动可能会影响到他人。秉承直率、有建设性和积极的态度。对您的影响和您的错误负责——如果某人表示您的言行使其受到伤害，请仔细聆听、诚恳道歉并及时改正。

;Be Direct but Professional
直率而专业


;We are likely to have some discussions about if and when criticism is respectful and when it’s not. We <em>must</em> be able to speak directly when we disagree and when we think we need to improve. We cannot withhold hard truths. Doing so respectfully is hard, doing so when others don’t seem to be listening is harder, and hearing such comments when one is the recipient can be even harder still. We need to be honest and direct, as well as respectful.
我们可能会就批评是否展现尊重进行一些讨论。我们<em>必须</em>能在我们未有共识时，以及认为需改进时直言不讳。我们必须知无不言，言无不尽。在表达时要表现尊重的态度并不容易，在他人似乎没有聆听的情况下表现尊重的态度更不容易，听取他人的批评则是更更难。我们需要直言不讳，也需要表现尊重。


;Be Inclusive
海纳百川，有容乃大


;Seek diverse perspectives. Diversity of views and of people on teams powers innovation, even if it is not always comfortable. Encourage all voices. Help new perspectives be heard and listen actively. If you find yourself dominating a discussion, it is especially important to step back and encourage other voices to join in. Be aware of how much time is taken up by dominant members of the group. Provide alternative ways to contribute or participate when possible.

;Be inclusive of everyone in an interaction, respecting and facilitating people’s participation whether they are:
在互动中包容所有人，尊重并鼓励人们的参与，无论对方是否：


;Remote (on video or phone)
远程（通过视频或电话）


;Not native language speakers
非母语者


;Coming from a different culture
来自不同文化背景


;Using pronouns other than “he” or “she”
使用“他”或“她”以外的代词


;Living in a different time zone
居住在不同时区


;Facing other challenges to participate
面对其他可能会影响参与的挑战


;Think about how you might facilitate alternative ways to contribute or participate. If you find yourself dominating a discussion, step back. Make way for other voices and listen actively to them.
思考您可以如何促进其他方式的贡献或参与。如果您发现是自己主导讨论，请退后一步，为其他声音让路并积极倾听。


;Understand Different Perspectives
了解不同观点


;Our goal should not be to “win” every disagreement or argument. A more productive goal is to be open to ideas that make our own ideas better. Strive to be an example for inclusive thinking. “Winning” is when different perspectives make our work richer and stronger.

;Appreciate and Accommodate Our Similarities and Differences
求同存异，和而不同


;Mozillians come from many cultures and backgrounds. Cultural differences can encompass everything from official religious observances to personal habits to clothing. Be respectful of people with different cultural practices, attitudes and beliefs. Work to eliminate your own biases, prejudices and discriminatory practices. Think of others’ needs from their point of view. Use preferred titles (including pronouns) and the appropriate tone of voice. Respect people’s right to privacy and confidentiality. Be open to learning from and educating others as well as educating yourself; it is unrealistic to expect Mozillians to know the cultural practices of every ethnic and cultural group, but everyone needs to recognize one’s native culture is only part of positive interactions.

;Lead by Example
以身作则


;By matching your actions with your words, you become a person others want to follow. Your actions influence others to behave and respond in ways that are valuable and appropriate for our organizational outcomes. Design your community and your work for inclusion. Hold yourself and others accountable for inclusive behaviors. Make decisions based on the highest good for <a href="%(mission)s">Mozilla’s mission</a>.

;Personal Attacks
人身攻击


;Conflicts will inevitably arise, but frustration should never turn into a personal attack. It is not okay to insult, demean or belittle others. Attacking someone for their opinions, beliefs and ideas is not acceptable. It is important to speak directly when we disagree and when we think we need to improve, but such discussions must be conducted respectfully and professionally, remaining focused on the issue at hand.
冲突不可避免，但挫败感决不应变成人身攻击。不可侮辱、贬低或轻视他人。概不接受攻击某人的观点、信仰和想法。当我们有不同意见时，以及我们认为需改进时，直言不讳固然重要，但这样的讨论必须以尊重和专业的态度进行为前提，专注于处理眼前的问题。


;Derogatory Language
贬损的言语


;Hurtful or harmful language related to:
与下列有关的伤害性言语：

是不可接受的。包括故意以某人不认同的性别指代某人，和/或质疑个人性别认同的合法性。如果你不确定某个词句是否含有贬义，就请不要使用。这也包括不断影射和/或间接的歧视；当有人要求停止时，就请停止该行为。


;Unwelcome Sexual Attention or Physical Contact
