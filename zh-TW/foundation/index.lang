;The Mozilla Foundation
Mozilla 基金會


;The nonprofit Mozilla Foundation believes the Internet must always remain a global public resource that is open and accessible to all. Our work is guided by the <a href="%(url_manifesto)s">Mozilla Manifesto</a>.
非營利的 Mozilla 基金會相信，必須將網際網路維持成永久、全球性的公共資源，讓任何人都可隨意使用。<a href="%(url_manifesto)s">Mozilla Manifesto</a> 指導了我們的工作內容。


;The direct work of the Mozilla Foundation focuses on fueling the movement for an open Internet. We do this by connecting open Internet leaders with each other and by mobilizing grassroots activists around the world.
Mozilla 基金會的主要工作內容著重於為開放的網際網路加柴添火。我們透過將全球各地，開放網路的領導者連結起來，並動員全球各地的草根運動家來進行這些工作。


;The Foundation is also the sole shareholder in the Mozilla Corporation, the maker of Firefox and other open source tools. Mozilla Corporation functions as a self-sustaining social enterprise – money earned through its products is reinvested into the organization.
Mozilla 基金會是 Firefox 及其他開源工具的製造者: Mozilla 公司的全資股東。Mozilla 公司是一間自負盈虧的社會企業，透過產品所得的利潤將再投資於其自身。
