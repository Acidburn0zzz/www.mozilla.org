;Choice is a good thing
Izbor je dobra stvar


;Name 5 websites you visit daily. Now 10, 20 or even 30. Tricky, right? When a few big companies “own” the Internet, choice can be limited, but you don’t have to be.
Navedite 5 web stranica koje svakodnevno posjećujete. Sada 10, 20 ili čak 30. Nije tako jednostavno, zar ne? Kada nekoliko velikih kompanija “posjeduje” internet, izbor može biti ograničen, ali vi ne morate biti.

;Internet Privacy
Internet privatnost


;Internet’s got trust issues
Internet ima problema s povjerenjem


;Privacy shouldn’t be a privilege. In fact, the Internet only stays healthy if we trust it as a safe place – to explore, transact, connect and create.
Privatnost ne bi trebala biti privilegija. U stvari, internet ostaje zdrav samo ako vjerujemo da je on sigurno mjesto – za istraživanje, obavljanje transakcija, povezivanje i stvaranje.
