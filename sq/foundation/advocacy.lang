;Mozilla Advocacy
Aktivizëm te Mozilla


;Rallying citizens to protect the open Internet
Mobilizim i qytetarëve për mbrojtjen e Internetit të hapur


;Mozilla’s advocacy engine works with allies to cultivate a global force of tens of millions of people, who are aware of the issues that are vital to the future of the open Internet and prepared to take action in support of the rights of citizens of the web.
Mekanizmi i Mozilla-s për aktivizëm punon me aleatë për të kultivuar një forcë globale prej dhjetëra milionë vetësh, të cilët të jenë të ndërgjegjshëm rreth çështjeve që janë jetike për Internetin e hapur dhe të përgatitur të hidhen në veprim në përkrahje të të drejtave të qytetarit në web.


;We are dedicated to building a world where:
I jemi përkushtuar ndërtimit të një bote ku:


;People are making more conscious choices to build and protect the open Internet
Njerëzit të bëjnë zgjedhje më të ndërgjegjshme lidhur me ndërtimin dhe mbrojtjen e një Interneti të hapur


;Companies and governments create products, policies and laws to support the open Internet because of public pressure to do so
Kompanitë dhe qeveritë të krijojnë produkte, politika dhe ligji që mbështesin Internetin e hapur, për shkak të presionit publike për të bërë kështu


;How we work: A focus on depth and scale
Si punojmë: Fokus në thellësi dhe shtrirje


;Mozilla’s advocacy approach incorporates both scale to depth and depth to scale to properly address the diversity of issues that we work on.
