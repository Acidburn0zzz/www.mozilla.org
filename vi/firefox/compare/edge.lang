So sánh trình duyệt Firefox với Microsoft Edge


;With Windows 10, Microsoft introduced its Edge browser to compete with Firefox and Chrome making it the default browser pre-installed on millions of PCs sold. Even so, users were slow to adopt it and Microsoft eventually announced plans to relaunch Edge as a Chromium-based browser (Chromium of course being Google’s Open Source browser project).
Với Windows 10, Microsoft đã giới thiệu trình duyệt Edge của mình để cạnh tranh với Firefox và Chrome khiến nó trở thành trình duyệt mặc định được cài đặt sẵn trên hàng triệu PC được bán ra. Mặc dù vậy, trình duyệt vẫn rất chậm và Microsoft cuối cùng đã công bố kế hoạch xây dựng lại Edge dưới dạng trình duyệt dựa trên Chromium (tất nhiên Chromium là dự án trình duyệt nguồn mở của Google).


;Here we’ll compare our Firefox Browser to the Chromium-based Microsoft Edge in terms of privacy, utility, and portability, to help you have a better understanding of which browser better suits your needs and preferences.
Ở đây, chúng tôi sẽ so sánh trình duyệt Firefox của chúng tôi với Microsoft Edge dựa trên Chromium về quyền riêng tư, tiện ích và tính di động, để giúp bạn hiểu rõ hơn về trình duyệt nào phù hợp hơn với nhu cầu và sở thích của bạn.


;Edge is integrated into the Windows 10 platform and runs in a sandbox environment, meaning it isolates programs and prevents malicious programs from spying on your computer. It has a built-in SmartScreen that scans the reputation of sites you visit and blocks suspicious sites. To enhance privacy, Edge allows you to use biometrics or a PIN with Windows Hello instead of passwords for online authentication.
Edge được tích hợp vào nền tảng Windows 10 và chạy trong môi trường hộp cát, nghĩa là nó cách ly các chương trình và ngăn các chương trình độc hại gián điệp trên máy tính của bạn. Nó có SmartScreen tích hợp để quét danh tính của các trang web bạn truy cập và chặn các trang web đáng ngờ. Để tăng cường quyền riêng tư, Edge cho phép bạn sử dụng sinh trắc học hoặc mã PIN với Windows Hello thay vì mật khẩu để xác thực trực tuyến.


;However, Edge saves some of your private data and sends it back to Microsoft with Windows updates. At 45 cryptically worded pages long, the privacy policy for Edge is unlikely to be read or understood by the average user.
Tuy nhiên, Edge lưu một số dữ liệu riêng tư của bạn và gửi lại cho Microsoft bằng các bản cập nhật Windows. Với 45 trang được mã hóa dài, chính sách bảo mật cho Edge khó có thể được đọc hoặc hiểu bởi người dùng trung bình.


;At Firefox, our <a %(attrs)s>privacy policy</a> is transparent and in plain language. We actually put a lot of work into making sure it was straightforward and easy to read. We pride ourselves in protecting our users security and privacy. With Enhanced Tracking Protection now on by default, we block 2000+ trackers automatically. Trackers are those little pieces of code that try to piece together what you're doing across multiple internet sites to build a composite and detailed picture of who you are, compromising your privacy all just to target better ads.

;In Firefox, Private Browsing mode automatically erases your browsing information like passwords, cookies, and history, leaving no trace after you close out the session. Edge on the other hand, actually records browsing history in their private mode (called “InPrivate”) and it’s a relatively easy task for someone to reconstruct your full browsing history, regardless of whether your browsing was done in regular or InPrivate mode.

;Both browsers are relatively equal in terms of data encryption. However, if online privacy and transparency are important to you, then Firefox is clearly a better choice here.

;Firefox is a fast and open source browser, which means users can customize their browsing experience in every way possible. Firefox also allows the casual user several different ways to customize the UI with applying different themes and toolbar configurations. Since our browser has always been open source we have a large following of devoted developers who have created an extensive library of add-ons and browser extensions.

;Since Edge has moved to the processor intensive Chromium platform, you can expect it to run a little slower, especially if you have multiple programs running at once. However, with Chromium platform comes a massive library of extensions as well as a decent level of UI customization that Edge did not have before it’s move to Chromium.

;Edge has some nice UI features, like their tab previews which can make it easy to find the right open tabs if you’ve got a lot of them open. Another helpful tab-related feature lets you set aside any active tabs that you aren’t using but don’t want to close down.

;Firefox features a scrolling tab interface, which keeps tab information viewable and scrolls them horizontally instead of shrinking them down to just favicon size. Also whenever you open a new tab, our <a %(attrs)s>Pocket feature</a> suggests relevant articles and content for you. Plus with Pocket, you can also save articles, videos, and other content with one click, for reading at a later time.

;Firefox and Edge both offer excellent reading modes. With Firefox you just tap on the small icon in the search bar and the browser strips down all unnecessary elements and presents you a clean looking article. In Edge you just tap on the small book icon and browser to get a clean easy-to-read UI.

# "Out of the gate" means from the very start. Alternative: "From the start,". Race horses are held behind a gate that is opened to release all the horses at the same time at the start of the race, so a horse that leads the race from the very start is said to lead "right out of the gate."
;Out of the gate, Firefox has more features and integrations built into the browser and readily available on download. And while both browsers have a tremendous number of add-ons and extensions available, Edge’s compatibility with Google’s Chromium platform gives it the advantage in terms of sheer numbers.

;With Internet Explorer, Microsoft learned from its lack of availability across platforms and made Edge available for macOS and Android. The software is now readily available on iOS, Android, Windows and Mac.

;Aside from sucking up a lot of computing power, Edge running on Chromium has answered a lot of users’ needs for functionality and features. But there’s still a lot to account for in terms of the browser’s privacy protections. It’s our assessment that Firefox is still a better choice for most people to use in their daily lives, based not only on functionality but more importantly on our transparency in how we collect user data, what exactly we collect, and what we do with it. Because our parent company is <a %(attrs)s>Mozilla</a>, a non-profit organization dedicated to internet privacy and freedom, we simply have a different set of priorities when it comes to users’ data.

;The bottom line is that while we suggest using Firefox, the best browser for you ultimately will be the one that fits your individual needs with extension support, browsing tools customization, speed, privacy and security.
