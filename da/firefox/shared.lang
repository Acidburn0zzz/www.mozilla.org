;Firefox doesn’t sell access to your personal information like other companies. From privacy tools to tracking protection, you’re in charge of who sees what.
Firefox sælger ikke adgang til dine personlige informationer som andre firmaer. Fra privatlivsfunktioner til beskyttelse mod sporing - du bestemmer, hvem der ser hvad.
