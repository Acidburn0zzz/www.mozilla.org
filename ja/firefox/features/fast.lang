より高速で軽量になった Firefox


# Working out means exercising to get lighter and more proficent.  Here it means Firefox is lighter thus the speed faster.

;Use less memory
メモリ消費量の削減


# A hog is something that claims or takes all of everything. Here it references to a program that takes up all the resources and slow down the computer.
# Lean and mean here means having no excess of what's needed and is single focused. Mean also is defined as nasty, thus the reference of "we're pretty nice". Be transcreative if needed.
;No one likes a computer hog! Firefox is a lean, mean (actually we’re pretty nice) browsing machine. Since we use less RAM than Chrome, your other programs can keep running at top speed.
メモリ食いなアプリが好きな人はいませんよね。Firefox は軽量で小粋なブラウジングマシンです。Chrome より使う RAM が少ないので、他のプログラムも高速に動かせます。
