;Government surveillance explained
サーベイランスとは


;Stakeouts have always been an essential tool for law enforcement and national security.
法の執行や国家の安全保障にとって、張り込み調査はいつの時代も有効な手法でした。


;The difference now is that they’ve moved beyond binoculars, bugs and bad guys: surveillance has gone digital.
しかし、現代の張り込みはもはや双眼鏡や隠しカメラ、牛乳とあんぱんの世界観ではありません。政府による監視（サーベイランス）はすでにデジタル化してしまったのです。


;All that data we generate through our daily activities online allows governments to keep an eye on lots of people at once, in hopes of catching the ones who are up to no good.
私たちが日々のオンライン活動で生産しているデータによって、政府はよからぬことを企んでいる人を探すために、一度に多くの人びとを監視できるようになりました。


;It’s like grabbing a giant haystack just in case there might be a needle inside.
これは、巨大な干し草の山をかき分けて、紛れ込んでいるかもしれない針を探すようなものです。


;Stored info is vulnerable info
データの保存には、脆弱性が伴います


;In order to tailor personal experiences for you, virtually every technology company you interact with collects and stores some amount of your personal information.
ユーザの体験をその人により合ったものにするために、ほぼすべてのテック企業はユーザの情報をある程度収集・保存しています。

;Under certain circumstances, those companies can be forced to <a href="{url}">turn over your information to governments</a>.
こうしてユーザから収集したデータを、企業は<a href="{url}">政府の命令によって提出</a>しなければならないことがあります。


;So what should companies do?
では、企業に何ができるか。


;They can be proactive about protecting users’ information by limiting data collection to what’s needed, making data anonymous where possible, and deleting data when it’s no longer necessary.
データの収集を必要最低限に抑え、可能な場合はデータを匿名化し、不必要になったデータは破棄することによってユーザの個人情報を積極的に保護することができます。

;The solution: Safeguards
解決策：セーフガード


;When surveillance is too broad or lacks key safeguards – like getting a warrant from a judge – it can be abused, either accidentally or on purpose. And our personal privacy is what’s at stake.
サーベイランスが広範囲に及んでいたり、裁判所からの礼状など重要な保障措置が欠けている場合、故意があってもなくても乱用される可能性が増大します。そして、これによって危険にさらされるのは、私たちのプライバシーです。

;“Some amount of surveillance for law enforcement and intelligence, properly designed, is valuable to keep us safe. But when it’s too broad, it violates the privacy rights of millions of innocent people, and can even undermine our security.”
