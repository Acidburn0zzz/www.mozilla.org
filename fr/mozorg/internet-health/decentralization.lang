;Decentralization: Vital to Internet Health
La décentralisation : essentielle à la bonne santé d’Internet


# Used as HTML description of the page
;A decentralized internet, owned by all of us, is where net neutrality, interoperability, competition, and local contribution thrive.

;A healthy Internet is created and owned by us all
Un Internet en bonne santé nous appartient et nous y participons tous


;The Internet owes much of its success to openness: its open, shared structure has made it easy for everyone to build, surf, and thrive on it. But a few big companies are closing in, closing doors, and creating walled gardens that concentrate their ownership and control of the Web. Together, we can fight to make sure no one limits our Internet access, experience, or creation.

;A healthy Internet belongs to you.

;Here are four areas where we can make a difference.
Voici quatre domaines dans lesquels nous pouvons changer la donne.


;Net Neutrality

;Interoperability

;Decentralization means Net Neutrality
La décentralisation dépend de la neutralité du Net


;No one should be able to restrict our access to the Web for their own gain.
Personne ne devrait pouvoir brider notre accès à Internet pour servir leurs propres intérêts.


;We rely on network providers – telcos and cable companies – for access to the Internet. Which puts them in a position to restrict that access for their own business objectives, favoring their own products, blocking sites or brands, or charging different prices and offering different speeds depending on content type. Net neutrality prohibits network providers from discriminating based on content, so everyone has equal access.

;Keep speaking up
En exprimant votre point de vue


;The fight for net neutrality continues all over the world. The rules that have been adopted in the US and Europe need to be defended and enforced. Reach out to your government official wherever you live, and express your support.
Le combat pour la neutralité du Net se poursuit dans le monde entier. La réglementation adoptée aux États-Unis et en Europe doit être défendue et appliquée. Interpellez les représentants des pouvoirs publics où que vous viviez, et faites-leur part de votre point de vue.

;Interoperability is a big word with a simple result: your Web experience is basically the same across browsers, hardware, and operating systems because it was designed that way – and built with the open standards to support it. Open standards also allow anyone to invent new ways to make your Web experience better. But interoperability is losing ground to closed systems – and we’re losing transparency, participation, and innovation along with it.

;A personalized Internet is an exciting prospect. But more and more, that means opting into a single company’s ecosystem – which streamlines your experience right now, but may seriously limit your choices in the future. Competitors will be reduced to those few companies who can offer the whole enchilada, thus consolidating the power of existing tech giants and making it much harder for entrepreneurs to disrupt the market with great ideas.

;Today 3 billion people all over the world use the Internet to learn, work, play, and connect. But not everyone is able to contribute to it equally. Which means the Web doesn’t reflect the full diversity of its users, doesn’t work as well for some people as others, and can even marginalize certain communities and individuals.
